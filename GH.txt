SOME SPAM MAIL EXAMPLES

A cure for spam?             We opened a spam message and found a wonderful offer for (you guessed it) a service for eliminating spam.



A super deal ?               You can buy software on line at incredibly low prices. Is this a good deal? We think not. 
                             After all, "incredible" really means "not credible".



You have won!                You would not open an e-mail with a title like this, would you? Or would you? 
                             What if you had been pre-conditioned first? This is rather sneaky.



A Marketing Ploy?            What do you do when you are told you are paying for a service you did not ask for, or being dunned for a service you thought you had dropped?
